## Research interests

I like to work on problems that feature an interaction between geometry, combinatorics, and algorithmic considerations.	Very often I work on theoretical problems arising from applied settings. More specifically, I have worked quite a bit on the combinatorial theory of infinite, symmetric bar-joint frameworks, with applications in crystallography, and, recently, on combinatorial-algebraic approaches to inverse problems in machine learning.
