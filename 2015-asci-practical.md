## Information for incoming AScI interns

This page collects some practical information for students 
taking part in the Summer program on 
[Mechanical function from geometry and topology][mechgt].
Since Aalto HR and the AScI coordinator are in charge of 
communication with respect to employement matters, this 
page should be considered informative.  However, we have tried
to make it as accurate as possible.

## Important contact information

If you need a more detailed respose, you can contact:

AScI coordinator
: [Minna Lind][minna]

Aalto HR
: [Noora Koskivaara][noora]

[minna]: minna.lind@aalto.fi
[noora]: noora.koskivaara@aalto.fi

The rest of this document is a step-by-step guide, followed by 
some miscelaneous information.

## The offer letter and work contract

This is the first step. Once you've accepted, you will need to send:

* Your transcript
* The [Aalto personal data form][form5]

to Dr. Lind.  These are enough to generate an official offer
letter and work contract.  (Your transcript is used to calculate the 
exact salary, which is at least 1600€ / mo.)

_Note about banking:_ Aalto can pay you directly into bank accounts 
in (at least) the [SEPA area][sepa], United States, and Canada. Just
enter your normal banking information into the personal data form.

## Before you arrive
Here are some tasks you'll need to take care of before you arrive.

_Finalize your start and end dates:_ 
The next step is to finalize your start and end dates.  This should 
be coordinated with Daniel, Marcelo, and Louis, and reported to Dr. Lind.
Once your dates are fixed, a housing reservation can be made with the 
[Aalto Student's Union][ayy].  Housing costs about 250€ / mo and requires
a 250€ deposit.

The standard dates, are Jun. 1–Aug. 31.  These are also most convenient 
in terms of housing, but we have some flexibility.

_Book your plane tickets:_
After you arrive, 
you will be reimbursed for an economy-class, round-trip ticket to Helsinki
from the country where you study.  If the costs are comparable, e.g., US vs. Canada
or all the flights are within Europe, we can probably make an exception, but
check in advance.  There is a
maximum reimbursement of 1200€, so book in advance to get a good rate. 

_Check your health insurance status:_ If you don't have an EU health card, 
you should check that your health insurance covers care in Finland and 
buy an appropriate add-on if necessary. You will not be covered by the 
Finnish system.

## After you arrive
Once you arrive, you will need to get things set up.  Do all of these 
tasks right away.

_Get a tax card:_ In order to be paid, you will need to get a 
tax card from the [Finnish tax authority][vero].  The office 
you need to go to is [Into Finland][into], since it can 
issue you an ID number and tax card at the same time. You don't 
need an appointment. You'll need to bring:

* Your passport or European ID card
* Your work contract
* A confirmation of your tax status at home (e.g., a pay stub or tax return)
* A confirmation that you have health insurance and social insurance in your home country

Ask for a "progressive tax card" (there are [details on VERO's site][prog]). This can result in a much lower rate and 
can't increase it. Past interns have paid between 0-5% on the amount over
500€ or so.

_Bring your tax card to HR:_ Bring your tax card and signed work contract to 
Noora Koskivaara. This will allow you to start being paid and activate you 
in the HR system.

_Open your Aalto IT account:_ TBD
