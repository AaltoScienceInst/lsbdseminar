title: Mechanics and metamaterials
---

These four projects follow a theme and will be semi-jointly 
supervised by [Daniel][dan], [Marcelo][marc], [Louis][lt]

## Design of mechanical meta-materials

### Field of study: Structural mechanics, Physics, Applied Mathematics

### Contact person(s): _Marcelo_, Daniel, Louis

### Professor: Olli Ikkala

Mechanical structures (including 2d and 3d lattices, polyhedral 
surfaces, etc.) have recently been shown to display a wide variety of 
interesting behaviors such as:

* nevative Poisson ratio
* netative coeff. of thermal expansion
* symmetric collapses

In this project, we will try to understand the kinematics and mechanics of 
of these kinds of materials via simple modeling and table-top experiments,
using 3d printing.  

You will learn how to create meta-materials in the lab and gain intution 
by interacting with them directly. Then you'll see how to formalize your
hypotheses in terms of equilibrium analysis of elastic and stiff materials.

Students in physics or mechanical engineering are especially encouraged
to apply.  Some experience with lab work or 3d printing will be helpful, 
but is not required.

## Physics and geometry of complex structures

### Field of study: Structural mechanics, Physics, (Applied) Mathematics

### Contact persons: _Daniel_, Marcelo, Louis

### Professor: Mikko Alava 

The mechanics of soft materials allows structures to be designed that undergo large deformations. 
Understanding these theoretically is challenging, because these deformations tend to exhibit 
geometric non-linearity, even for structures designed from simple, repeating motifs.

In this project we will explore how elastic instability instablity can be utilized to 
bring about novel, global mechanical properties.

You will learn the geometrical tools to understand the kinematics and degrees of freedom
in a structure; how to derive constitutive laws; and how to derive the mechanical
equilibrium equations for the structure... instability analysis... perturbation theory...

Students in physics or applied mathematics are especially encouraged to apply.  Some 
experience with numerical simulations, and finite element methods will be 
helpful but not required.  Some programming skill (e.g., Mathematica, MATLAB, Python, Java) 
is necessary.

## Boundary effects in isostatic systems

### Field of study: Math, Physics

### Contact persons: _Louis_, Daniel, Marcelo

### Professor: Petteri Kaski

Networks of stiff bars connected by rotational joints have recently 
been shown to exhibit behaviors associated with soft matter and 
quantum systems.  Because these kinds of networks (and also ones
arising in jamming) are either flexible or isostatic, boundary 
conditions used either in theoretical analysis or simulations 
take on an extra signifigance.

In this project, we will explore how different kinds of boundary 
conditions affect what can be seen about the geometry of bulk
motions.

You will learn the mathemtical and computational tools for 
analyzing linkages.  Then you will apply them for making 
theoretical predictions about how boundary conditions on
finite patches of large systems affect what can be seen.
To get intuition, you will create models using 3d printing 
and laser cutter.
