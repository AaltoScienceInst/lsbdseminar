A local train  stops at stations 0, 1, . . . , T  and passengers
getting in and out a wagon are counted at every station. Since
passengers are not labeled and with the same ticket it is possible to
travel across all the line, when a passenger gets off the train, it is
not known from which station he started. The distribution of the
individual trips satisfies a constrained system of linear
diophanitine equations, which typically is underdetermined.
Nevertheless we show that, when i.i.d. realizations are
collected , the probability distribution of the travel lengths,
depending on the passengerâ€™s departure station is identifiable.
We use a Bayesian data augmentation, where the the
distribution of the individual trips is the hidden variable. The
posterior distribution is explored by the fiber walk Markov chain
Monte introduced by Diaconis and Sturmfels 1998.
