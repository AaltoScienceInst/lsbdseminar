Delaunay triangulations are a central object in many areas of mathematics and
computational geometry. However, little is known about which combinatorial types can
appear as a Delaunay triangulation. With an inverse stereographic projection, this
question translates to asking which combinatorial types of polytopes admit realizations
with all the vertices on a sphere. We will construct a large family of neighborly
polytopes that are not only inscribable on the sphere, but also in every smooth strictly
convex body. This provides the current best lower bound for the number of combinatorial
types of Delaunay triangulations. In the second part of the talk, we will use these
techniques to show that realization spaces of inscribed polytopes present Universality in
the sense of Mnëv. For example, this will allow us to construct a pair of point
configurations whose Delaunay triangulations are combinatorially equivalent but yet there
is no continuous transformation that maps one to the other without changing the Delaunay
triangulation.

This talk reports joint work with Karim Adiprasito, Bernd Gonska and Louis Theran.
