In this talk, I present some of our most recent work on applying tools from compressed sensing to (semi-supervised) machine learning with massive network-structured datasets, i.e., big data over networks. We expect the use of compressed sensing ideas game changing as it was for digital signal processing. In particular, I will present a sparse label propagation algorithm which efficiently learns the labels for data points based on the availability of a few labeled training data points. This algorithm is inspired by compressed sensing recovery methods and allows for
a simple sufficient condition on the network structure which guarantees accurate learning.
