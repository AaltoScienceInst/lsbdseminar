A graph $$G$$ is generically globally rigid (GGR) in dimension $$d$$ 
if, for a generic bar-joint framework $$(G,p)$$ any other $$d$$-dimensional 
framework $$(G,q)$$ with the same edge lengths is related to $$(G,p)$$ 
by a Euclidean motion.  A stronger notion is that of universal rigidity, 
in which $$(G,q)$$ may be in any dimension $$D\ge d$$.  Universal rigidity 
is known not a to be generic property, but we can show that for any GGR graph, 
there are open sets of universally rigid frameworks.  This answers a question 
of Gortler and Thurston.

The approach is to analyze a construction of Alfakih that relates 
so-called "super stable" configurations to orthogonal representations
of graphs introduced by Lov√°sz, Saks and Schrijver.

This is joint work with Bob Connelly and Shlomo Gortler.
