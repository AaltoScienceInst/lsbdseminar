Networks of rigid bars connected by joints, termed linkages, provide a
minimal framework to design robotic arms and mechanical metamaterials
built out of folding components.  These linkages may admit motions
that perform useful functions.  Can these motions be made to be
topologically robust?  I will explain this question and illustrate our
answer with a chain-like linkage that, according to linear elasticity,
behaves like a topological mechanical insulator whose zero-energy
modes are localized at the edge. Simple experiments we performed using
prototypes of the chain vividly illustrate how this edge mode can in
fact propagate unobstructed all the way to the opposite end. Indeed,
the chain is a mechanical conductor, whose carriers are nonlinear
solitary waves, not captured within linear elasticity. This chain can
be regarded as the simplest example of a topological mechanical
metamaterial whose protected excitations are solitons, moving domain
walls between distinct topological mechanical phases.  Live
demonstrations on real toys will be performed.  (Based on work with
Nitin Upadhyaya and Vincenzo Vitelli).
