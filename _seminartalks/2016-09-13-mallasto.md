In probability theory we can define orderings for random variables, which we call stochastic orderings. In this talk I will cover a stochastic ordering arising from supermodular functions and present how such a relation is determined in practice. Furthermore, I will talk about supermodular regularity defined on Markov chains, and present a simple result for binary Markov chains. All in all, this talk will cover my internship project under the supervision of Kaie Kubjas and Lasse Leskel√§ during the summer 2016.
