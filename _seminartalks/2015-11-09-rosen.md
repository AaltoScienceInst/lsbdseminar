A neural code is a set of 0-1 vectors (codewords) derived from the non-empty non-covered regions of a collection of sets in Rn. The code is said to be convex if there exists a convex set arrangement generating the code. This definition is motivated by place cells in neuroscience, which won its discoverers the 2014 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

The question we tackle: what makes a neural code convex? We use commutative algebra, topology, and discrete geometry to place some necessary conditions and describe the minimal realizing dimension of a convex neural code. Based on joint work with Carina Curto, Elizabeth Gross, Jack Jeffries, Katie Morrison, Mohamed Omar, Anne Shiu, and Nora Youngs.
