In 2014, Eric Sjöland, a recent graduate from Aalto, asked for the minimal number of arithmetic progressions of a certain length among all fixed-density subsets of a group. In the special case where $G$ is a cyclic group of prime order and the length of the arithmetic progressions is 3, he was able to contribute the first - and by now only - results for that question, including a lower bound for all primes. For this result he used some methods from real algebraic geometry.
The speaker's aim is to find ways to enhance the result of Sjöland and generalize it. For that he sets the problem in the context of moment matrices. The speaker is a master student from Cologne, Germany, who started writing his master's thesis in recently at AScI under the supervision of Cordian Riener.
