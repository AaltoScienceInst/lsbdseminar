title: "Large Structures Seminar - Julien Barré"

Consider balls that are linked together by bars of fixed lengths; the balls act as pivots around which the bars can rotate. Is the structure obtained rigid or floppy? We will introduce this problem and explain its links with graph theory. When this question is examined for large structures and in a probabilistic setting, it is called «rigidity percolation». We will then present old and new results and conjectures for rigidity percolation obtained by physicists and mathematicians, mostly on random graphs.
