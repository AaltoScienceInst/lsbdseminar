Over the past thirty years, the ancient art of paper folding, or origami, has evolved into an interdisciplinary scientific field. Origami offers the possibility for new metamaterials whose overall mechanical properties can be programmed by acting locally on each crease. Origami metamaterials show for example auxetic behaviour (negative Poisson ratio) and multistability, the latter allowing reprogrammable configurations and deployable structures. Starting from a thin plate and knowing the properties of the material and the folding procedure, one would like to determine the shape taken by the structure at rest and its mechanical response. During this talk, I review some recent experimental and theoretical developments on the physics and mechanics of origami-based metamaterials.
