Let $$d$$  be a positive integer and let $$\mu$$ be a positive Borel measure on
$$\mathbf{R}^2$$ possessing moments up to degree $$2d-1$$. Every such measure defines a linear from $$L\in\mathbf{R}[X,Y]_{2d-1}^*$$, which can be decomposed into a positive combination of point evaluations, i.e., 

$$L(f)=\sum_{v\in S\subset\mathbf{R}^2} \lambda_v f(v),$$ 

where $$S$$ is a finte set of  nodes and  $$\lambda_v\geq 0$$ are the corresponding  weights. Such a decomposition is called a cubature rule for the given measure. We study the question of bounding the minimal number of nodes necessary and give generalizations of the well known Gau√ü-quadrature on the real line to the two-dimensional case.  

In particular, we show that for every $$\mu$$ there is always a cubature rule with at
most $$\frac{3}{2}d(d-1) + 1$$ many nodes, which is chosen such that its value on a 
fixed positive definite form of degree $$2d$$ is minimized.
