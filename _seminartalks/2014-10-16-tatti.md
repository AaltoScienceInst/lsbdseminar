Discovering dense subgraphs is one the fundamental problems in graph mining. A
known result states that if we use average degree to measure density, then we
can discover the densest subgraph in polynomial time.  We extend this result by
considering the problem of discovering multiple dense subgraphs.  More
specifically, we consider discovering subgraphs whose density cannot be
improved by adding or replacing nodes.  We show that these subgraphs form a
chain and that each subgraph is the densest subgraph containing properly the
previous subgraph.  We demonstrate that these subgraphs can be discovered in
polynomial time and provide a linear-time 1/2-approximation algorithm that
bridges k-core decomposition and discovering dense subgraphs.
