n the graph motif problem, we are given as input a vertex-colored graph H
(the host graph) and a multiset of colors M (the motif). Our task is to decide
whether H has a connected set of vertices whose multiset of colors agrees
with M. From a theory perspective the graph motif problem is known to
occupy a somewhat curious position. Namely it is (i) NP-complete, but
(ii) admits algorithms whose worst-case running time scales linearly
in the number of edges in H (and exponentially in the size of M).
Thus, as long as M remains small, there are no theoretical obstacles that
would prevent scaling to large graphs. This talk reviews one possible algebraic
design framework for such linear-time algorithms, [constrained multilinear
sieving][1], and presents some empirical evidence that such designs
are viable in practice.

Joint work with Andreas Björklund, Łukasz Kowalik, and Juho Lauri.
