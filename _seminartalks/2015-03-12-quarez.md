We will study the rational functions of the plane which are continuous and which become regular after one blowing-up. These functions defined a sub-ring of the ring of the so-called regulous functions introduced by Kucharz for their applications to some topological problems. We will focus on the algebraic properties of this ring of regulous functions which becomes regular after one blowing up, and we will state in particular a real Nullstellenstaz and a Positivestellensatz.
