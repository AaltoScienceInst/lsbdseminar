Cooperative locally repairable codes have recently gathered wide interest, both for their applications in large scale distributed storage systems, and for their purely mathematical properties. In this talk, we consider a (to our knowledge) new generalization of locally repairable codes, where the repair can be performed on several different scales, further enhancing the robustness of a storage system. 

We analyze locally repairable codes from the perspective of the strong connection between linear codes and matroids, and more generally between arbitrary codes and polymatroids. We prove that a certain type of Singleton-like bounds are equivalent for matroids and codes, and apply well known techniques to calculate Tutte and rank polynomials to determine the weight enumeration polynomials on locally repairable codes.
