A hypergraph $$G=(V,E)$$ is $$(k,\ell )$$-sparse if no subset $$V' \subset V$$ spans more than $$k\lvert V'\rvert − \ell $$ hyperedges. We characterize $$(k,\ell)$$ -sparse hypergraphs in terms of graph theoretic, matroidal and algorithmic properties. We extend several well-known theorems of Haas, Lovász, Nash-Williams, Tutte, and White and Whiteley, linking arboricity of graphs to certain counts on the number of edges. We also address the problem of finding lower-dimensional representations of sparse hypergraphs, and identify a critical behaviour in terms of the sparsity parameters $$k$$ and $$\ell$$. Our constructions extend the pebble games of Lee and Streinu from graphs to hypergraphs.
