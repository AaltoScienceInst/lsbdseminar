Benson Farb and Chris Leininger had asked how many pairwise non-isotopic simple closed
curves can be placed on a surface of genus $$g$$ in such a way that any two of the curves
intersect at most once. In this note we use combinatorial methods to give bounds (a lower
bound of $$(g+1)g$$ curves, and an exponential upper bound). While the bounds for the
general Farb/Leininger question are (conjecturally) weak, the results presented here are
of independent interest.
