title: Finding and maintaining rigid components
year: 2005
conferenceprocname: CCCGâ€™05
---

We give the first complete analysis that the complexity of finding and maintaining *rigid
components* of planar bar-and-joint frameworks and arbitrary $$d$$-dimensional
body-and-bar frameworks, using a family of algorithms called pebble games, is $$O(n^2)$$.
To this end, we introduce a new data structure problem called union pair-find, which
maintains disjoint edge sets and supports pair-find queries of whether two vertices are
spanned by a set.

We present solutions that apply to generalizations of the pebble game algorithms, beyond the original rigidity motivation.
