title: Henneberg constructions and covers of cone-Laman graphs
year: 2012
---

We give Henneberg-type constructions for three families of sparse colored graphs arising
in the rigidity theory of periodic and other forced symmetric frameworks. The proof
method, which works with Laman-sparse finite covers of colored graphs highlights the
connection between these sparse colored families and the well-studied matroidal $$(k,
\ell)$$-sparse families.
