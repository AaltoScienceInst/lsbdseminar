We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of
incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry
can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds
on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact.
For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel
implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to
our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods.
