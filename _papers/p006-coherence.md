title: Coherence and sufficient sampling densities for reconstruction in compressed sensing
year: 2013
---

We introduce a concept called coherence for signals and constraints in compressed
sensing. In our setting, we assume that the signal can be observed in finitely many
features, and the set of possibly observable feature combinations forms an analytic
variety which models the compression constraints. We study the question how many random
measurements of the feature components suffice to identify all features. We show that the
asymptotics of the sufficient number of measurements is determined by the coherence of
the signal; furthermore, if the constraints are algebraic, we show that in general the
asymptotics depend only on the coherence of the constraints, and not on the true signal,
and derive results which explain the form of known bounds in compressed sensing. We
exemplify our approach by deriving sufficient sampling densities for low-rank matrix
completion and distance matrix completion which are independent of the true matrix.
