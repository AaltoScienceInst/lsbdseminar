We give a combinatorial characterization of minimally rigid planar frameworks with
orientation-preserving crystallographic symmetry, under the constraint of forced
symmetry. The main theorems are proved by extending the methods of the first paper in
this sequence from groups generated by a single rotation to groups generated by
translations and rotations. The proof makes use of new families of matroids and
submodular functions defined on crystallographic groups.
