title: The slider-pinning problem

A *Laman mechanism* is a flexible planar bar-and-joint framework with $$m \le 2n−3$$
edges and exactly $$k=2n− m$$ degrees of freedom. The *slider-pinning problem* is to
eliminate all the degrees of freedom of a Laman mechanism, in an optimal fashion, by
individually fixing $$x$$ or $$y$$ coordinates of vertices. We describe two easy to
implement $$O(n^2)$$ time algorithms.
