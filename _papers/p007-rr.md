title: "Frameworks with forced symmetry I: reflections and rotations"
year: 2013
---

We give a combinatorial characterization of generic frameworks that are minimally rigid
under the additional constraint of maintaining symmetry with respect to a finite order
rotation or a reflection. To establish these results we develop a new technique for
deriving linear representations of sparsity matroids on colored graphs and extend the
direction network method of proving rigidity characterizations to handle reflections.
