title: Searching in tree-like partial orders
year: 2011
conferenceprocname: WADS’11
---

We give the first data structure for the problem of maintaining a dynamic set of n
elements drawn from a partially ordered universe described by a tree. We define the
Line-Leaf Tree, a linear-sized data structure that supports the operations: insert;
delete; test membership; and predecessor. The performance of our data structure is within
an $$O(log w)$$-factor of optimal. Here $$w \le n$$ is the width of the partial-order–a
natural obstacle in searching a partial order.
