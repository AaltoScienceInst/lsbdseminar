title: Algebraic-combinatorial methods for low-rank matrix completion with application to athletic performance prediction
year: 2014
---

This paper presents novel algorithms which exploit the intrinsic algebraic and combinatorial structure of the matrix completion task for estimating missing en- tries in the general low rank setting. For positive data, we achieve results out- performing the state of the art nuclear norm, both in accuracy and computational efficiency, in simulations and in the task of predicting athletic performance from partially observed data.
