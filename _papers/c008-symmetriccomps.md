title: Rigid components in fixed-lattice and cone frameworks
year: 2011
conferenceprocname: CCCGâ€™11

We study the fundamental algorithmic rigidity problems for generic frameworks periodic
with respect to a fixed lattice or a finite-order rotation in the plane. For
fixed-lattice frameworks we give an $$O(n^2)$$ 
algorithm for deciding generic rigidity and an
$$O(n^3)$$ algorithm for computing rigid components. 
If the order of rotation is part of the
input, we give an $$O(n^4)$$ algorithm for deciding rigidity; in the case where the
rotation's order is 3, a more specialized algorithm solves all the fundamental
algorithmic rigidity problems in $$O(n^2)$$ time.
