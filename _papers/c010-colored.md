title: Generic rigidity with forced symmetry and sparse colored graphs
year: 2014
---

We review some recent results in the generic rigidity theory of planar frameworks with
forced symmetry, giving a uniform treatment to the topic. We also give new combinatorial
characterizations of minimally rigid periodic frameworks with fixed-area fundamental
domain and fixed-angle fundamental domain.

**Note:** This conference was held in 2012, but the proceedings finally appeared
in 2014.
