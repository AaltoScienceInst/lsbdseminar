title: Delaunay triangulations with disconnected realization spaces
year: 2014
conferenceprocname: SoCG’14
---

We study realization spaces of Delaunay triangulations and show that they can be
arbitrarily complicated, and in particular disconnected. Our smallest example consists of
two configurations of $$29$$ labeled points in $$\mathbb{R}^25$$ whose Delaunay
triangulations are combinatorially equivalent but yet there is no continuous
transformation that maps one to the other without changing the triangulation. In general,
we prove that the realization space of a Delaunay triangulation in $$\mathbb{R}^2d$$ can
have $$\Omega(2^d)$$ connected components. Our proof uses Mnëv's Universality Theorem and
also shows that the realizability problem for Delaunay triangulations is polynomially
equivalent to the existential theory of the reals.
