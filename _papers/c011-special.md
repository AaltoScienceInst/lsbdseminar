title: Detecting dependencies in geometric constraint systems
conferenceprocname: ADG’14
year: 2014
---

Geometric constraint systems underly popular Computer Aided Design software. Automated
approaches for detecting dependencies in a design are critical for developing robust
solvers and provid- ing informative user feedback, and we provide algorithms that
recognize two types of dependencies. First, we give a pebble game algorithm for detecting
generic dependencies. Then, we focus on identifying the “special positions" of a design
in which generically independent constraints become dependent. We present combinatorial
algorithms for identifying subgraphs associated to factors of a particular polynomial,
whose vanishing indicates a special position and resulting dependency. Factors may allow
a geometric interpretation giving conditions (e.g., “these two lines being parallel cause
a dependency”) determining the special position.
