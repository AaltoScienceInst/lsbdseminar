title: Dual-to-kernel learning with ideals
year: 2014
---

In this paper, we propose a theory which unifies kernel learning and symbolic algebraic
methods. We show that both worlds are inherently dual to each other, and we use this
duality to combine the structure-awareness of algebraic methods with the efficiency and
generality of kernels. The main idea lies in relating polynomial rings to feature space,
and ideals to manifolds, then exploiting this generative-discriminative duality on kernel
matrices. We illustrate this by proposing two algorithms, IPCA and AVICA, for
simultaneous manifold and feature learning, and test their accuracy on synthetic and real
world data.
