We give a combinatorial characterization of generic minimal rigidity for planar periodic frameworks. The characterization is a true analogue of the Maxwell–Laman Theorem from rigidity theory: it is stated in terms of a finite combinatorial object and the conditions are checkable by polynomial time combinatorial algorithms.

To prove our rigidity theorem we introduce and develop periodic direction networks
and $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$-graded-sparse colored graphs.
