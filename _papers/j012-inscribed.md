title: Universality theorems for inscribed polytopes and Delaunay triangulations
year: 2015

We prove that every primary basic semialgebraic set is homotopy equivalent to the set of
inscribed realizations (up to Möbius transformation) of a polytope. If the semialgebraic
set is moreover open, then, in addition, we prove that (up to homotopy) it is a retract
of the realization space of some inscribed neighborly (and simplicial) polytope. We also
show that all algebraic extensions of $$\mathbb{Q}$$ are needed to coordinatize inscribed
polytopes. These statements show that inscribed polytopes exhibit the Mnëv universality
phenomenon.

Via stereographic projections, these theorems have a direct translation to universality
theorems for Delaunay subdivisions. In particular, our results imply that the
realizability problem for Delaunay triangulations is polynomially equivalent to the
existential theory of the reals.
