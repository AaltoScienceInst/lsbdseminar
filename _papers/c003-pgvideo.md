How many pair-wise distances must be prescribed between an unknown set of points, and how
should they be distributed, to determine only a discrete set of possible solutions? These
questions, and related generalizations, are central in a variety of applications.
Combinatorial rigidity shows that in two-dimensions one can get the answer, generically,
via an efficiently testable sparse graph property.

We present a video and a web site illustrating algorithmic results for a variety of
rigidity-related problems, as well as abstract generalizations. Our accompanying
interactive software is based on a comprehensive implementation of the pebble game
paradigm.
